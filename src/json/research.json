        "JUNEAU is a system of holistic data management tools which can find, standardize, and benefit from the existing resources in the data lake. With much improved scalability, the latest version of Juneau supports searching hierarchical and joined data as well as detecting composite data profiles",
        "Developed the recursive parsing algorithm that normalizes hierarchical data into base relational tables",
        "Initiated the use of sketching techniques to speed up the process of creating and matching data profiles",
        "Enhanced scalability through pre-computations, incremental techniques, and in-database implementations"
