I applied for Penn Labs on my very first semester at Penn, but didn't get in until freshman spring. I remember in the application form I was asked to provide my GitHub link and the url to my personal website (if any). But those were not even something I have thought of. I have never used GitHub before and do not have a personal website at all. So I stayed up the entire night before the application deadline to come up with one and thought it could give me a huge boost for my application. I didn't know React or any other framework and no javascript at all, so I was using raw html and css to write my website. Looking back, my old self appears to me as one of those primitive people not knowing how to use fire and tools. And so, I come up with this.
