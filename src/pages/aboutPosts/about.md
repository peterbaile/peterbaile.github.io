Hi! I am Peter, a senior studying [Networked &#38; Social Systems Engineering (NETS)](https://www.nets.upenn.edu/) at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/). Baile (百樂) is my Chinese first name, meaning a hundred happiness. I am interested in the intersection of databases, systems, and machine learning. Currently, I am a member of the PennDB group advised by [Prof. Zack Ives](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~zives/), building systems for ML. Outside of research, I am the student instructor of [CIS 197](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis197/) and a teaching assistant for [CIS 455/555](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis455/).

Things I do when I am free &#61; 🥊&nbsp;&nbsp;&plus;&nbsp;&nbsp;🏃&nbsp;&nbsp;&plus;&nbsp;&nbsp;🎮
