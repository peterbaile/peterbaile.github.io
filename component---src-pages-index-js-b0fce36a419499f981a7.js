I am Peter, a senior studying <a href=\\"https://www.nets.upenn.edu/\\">Networked &#x26; Social Systems Engineering (NETS)</a> at the <a href=\\"https://www.upenn.edu/\\">University of Pennsylvania</a>. Baile (ÁôæÊ®Ç) is my Chinese first name, meaning a hundred happiness. I am interested in the intersection of databases, systems, and machine learning. Currently, I am a member of the PennDB group advised by <a href=\\"https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~zives/\\">Prof. Zack Ives</a>, building systems for ML. Outside of research, I am the student instructor of <a href=\\"https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis197/\\">CIS 197</a> and a teaching assistant for <a href=\\"https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis455/\\">CIS 455/555</a>.</p>\\n<p>Things I do when I am free = ü•ä¬†¬†+¬†¬†üèÉ¬†¬†+¬†¬†üéÆ</p>\\n\x3c!-- I was born in the same place as the famous Chinese Mathematician [Hua Luogeng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hua_Luogeng) and lived in Shanghai for 14 years before my family moved to Hong Kong. --\x3e\\n\x3c!-- During my childhood, I spent most of my time helping my parents with their software retailing company and often went to the PC-assembling shops next door to only break things and later be scolded by my parents. Nonetheless, looking at customers coming to our little shop and always turning to Microsoft Windows/ Office and Intel CPUs as their first choices made me realize the brand power these tech companies have over consumers. This idea of making products is cool started to take root in my mind.\\n\\nHowever, it was not until a while later did I notice that building tech is way beyond just being cool. <mark>By the time I was 8, Steve Job\'s announcement of the first iPhone made me understand that tech can also be something that is <strong>impactful</strong>, something that can be created to <strong>better this society</strong>.</mark> Every now and then, there is the release of a new product that keeps me thrilled: Google\'s search engine, Elon Musk\'s rockets and electric cars and later Amazon\'s AWS. From then on, I decided to create something of my own which can also benefit this society the same way the aforementioned tech companies have done.\\n\\nConstanly motivated, I strive to better myself and have made direct impact on the lives of thousands of students & staff across Penn. I am now a full-stack web developer at [Penn Labs](https://pennlabs.org/) and the Director of the Web Department of [the Daily Pennsylvanian](https://www.thedp.com/). Quality only comes after great experiences and experiences can only be accumulated with relentless efforts. I hope that sometime in the future, with my creativity and expertise, I am able to contribute to the next page of the tech industry. --\x3e"}}}')},RXBc:function(e,t,a){"use strict";a.r(t);var n=a("JBLF"),s=a("q1tI"),i=a.n(s),o=a("vOnD"),r=a("85Sb"),m=a("vrFN"),h=o.a.div.withConfig({displayName:"pages__Wrapper",componentId:"s07gx5-0"})(["margin-top:4em;margin-bottom:2em;padding:0em 8em;@media screen and (max-width:768px){padding:0 2em;margin-bottom:0;}"]);t.default=function(){var e=n.data.markdownRemark,t=e.html,a=e.frontmatter.image;return i.a.createElement(i.a.Fragment,null,i.a.createElement(m.a,{title:"About"}),i.a.createElement("div",{className:"container-fluid h-100"},i.a.createElement("div",{className:"row h-100"},i.a.createElement(r.a,null),i.a.createElement(h,{className:"col-md-9 body-content"},i.a.createElement("div",{className:"text-center",style:{marginBottom:"3em"}},i.a.createElement("img",{src:"/images/"+a,className:"img-fluid",alt:"profile",height:"30%",width:"30%",style:{borderRadius:"50%"}})),i.a.createElement("div",null,"hello",i.a.createElement("p",{className:"text-justify",dangerouslySetInnerHTML:{__html:t},style:{marginBottom:"2em"}}))))))}}}]);
